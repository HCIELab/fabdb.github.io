1,2018,ColorMod: Recoloring 3D Printed Objects using Photochromic Inks,ACM CHI,"Parinya Punpongsanon, Xin Wen, David S Kim, Stefanie Mueller","Recent research has shown how to change the color of existing objects using photochromic materials. These materials can switch their appearance from transparent to colored when exposed to light of a certain wavelength. The color remains even when the object is removed from the light source. The process is fully reversible allowing users to recolor the object as many times as they want.
